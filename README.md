Hi there 👋

My name is **Utsav Sharma**. I like cryptographic proof systems, ethereum consensus mechanisms, and zkVMs.

**Currently:**
* Benchmarking consensus state transition functions inside zkVM at **Ethereum Protocol Fellowship**
* DeFi Backend Engineer at **Enclave**
* BS-MS Mathematics and Computing at **IIT Roorkee**

**Research & Projects:**

* Explored RANDAO bias elimination using threshold BLS signatures
* Developed [Selene](https://github.com/BlocSoc-iitr/selene) — Ethereum light client in Golang
* Studied zero-knowledge proof systems (Bulletproofs, SNARKs)

**Achievements:**
* EthOnline 2024 — Netherminds Track Prize
* Agentic Ethereum — Arbitrum Track Prize
* Based India Buildathon — Finalist

**Writing:**
* [Hash-Based Signature Schemes: From Lamport to FORS](https://0xsenpai.substack.com/p/hash-based-signature-schemes)
