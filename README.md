# Hi, I'm Utsav from IIT Roorkee! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate blockchain developer and part of [BlocSocIITR](https://github.com/BlocSoc-iitr/), specializing in decentralized technologies, decentralized finance , zero knowledge and Ethereum light clients. I am currently building [Enclave](https://www.enclave.money/) and I'm involved in various projects that span across building secure, trustless systems. Hereâ€™s a bit about me:

---

### ðŸ”­ Current Projects and Explorations
- **Selene** - A **light client for Ethereum** developed in Go, inspired by Helios, but optimized for a Go environment. It provides essential modules such as client and consensus, verified block headers, and executes Merkle proofs. Future plans include creating a wallet integrated with Selene, enhancing the decentralized experience.
- **PQC** - Working on implementing hash based signature schemes, diving into Post Quantum Cryptography to help contribute to beam clients
- **zk-SNARKs Integration** - Diving deeper into on-chain proof verifications and zero-knowledge proofs to enhance security and trust in decentralized applications.
- **ZKVM Benchmarks** - Executing Ethereum's Consensus Layer Transition Functions inside zkVms as part of [EPF](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-six)

### ðŸ’¡ Areas of Expertise
- **Blockchain Development**: Ethereum core,Ethereum Clients, EVM, consensus layers, light client architecture,DeFi protocols .
- **Cyptography and ZK**: Researching in the field of cryptography and ZK
- **ZKVMs and RISCV**: Learning about ZKVMs and digging deep into the RISC-V architecture to understand RISC-V ISA based ZKVMs
- **Programming Languages**: Rust, Go, Python, Solidity, SageMath, Typescript

### ðŸ“˜ Publishings and Writings
- **Blog Series on Hashâ€‘Based Signatures:** Covering Lamport, Winternitz, MSS, HORS/HORST/FORS
