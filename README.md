# Hi, I'm Utsav! 👋

I'm a passionate blockchain developer, specializing in decentralized technologies, algorithmic trading, and Ethereum light clients. Currently, I'm involved in various projects that span from building secure, trustless systems to managing NFT data and integrating web3 features with decentralized applications. Here’s a bit about me and what I’m working on:

---

### 🔭 Current Projects
- **Selene** - A **light client for Ethereum** developed in Go, inspired by Helios, but optimized for a Go environment. It provides essential modules such as client and consensus, verified block headers, and executes Merkle proofs. Future plans include creating a wallet integrated with Selene, enhancing the decentralized experience.
- **Neom** - A **trustless and permissionless portfolio manager**, powered by Selene, offering features like token balances, transaction history, portfolio value, and an NFT gallery. This project is designed to use decentralized data sources, making the data more secure and trustworthy.
- **EVM Execution & State Management** - Building an **EVM-based execution client package** in Go, working on block execution, state management, prefetching techniques, and implementing functionalities like `NewWitness` and `HeaderReader`.
- **NFT Data and Sales Aggregation** - Developing features to fetch NFT data from Base network on Alchemy and sales data from the Reservoir API. This includes integrating Alchemy API responses, extracting essential NFT information, and obtaining accurate floor prices from Reservoir for data accuracy.
- **Algorithmic Trading Strategies** - Researching and designing **trading strategies** for BTC/USDT to outperform benchmark returns. Involves comprehensive data handling, backtesting, risk management, and optimization for effective strategy deployment.

### 💡 Areas of Expertise
- **Blockchain Development**: Ethereum, EVM, consensus layers, light client architecture.
- **Programming Languages**: Rust, Go, and experience with Solidity and smart contract ecosystems.
- **Web3 Integrations**: Alchemy API, CoinGecko, CryptoCompare, Reservoir API.
- **zk-Proofs & Verifications**: Working with on-chain verification methods like Groth16, Plonk, and exploring the use of gnark and Risc0 verifiers.
- **Algorithmic Trading**: Cryptocurrency data acquisition, preprocessing, and strategy development.

---

### 🧑‍💻 Technologies I’m Using
- **Languages**: Rust 🦀, Go 🐹
- **Frameworks & Tools**: Ethereum Consensus and Execution layers, zk-SNARKS (Groth16, Plonk), Reservoir API, Alchemy API
- **Databases & Storage**: Transient storage, journaling systems for EVM states
- **Portfolio Management & DeFi**: Creating decentralized and secure data flows for portfolio management, with integration plans for Selene.

---

### 🌱 Currently Exploring
- **Advanced Precompiles** - Converting Ethereum-like precompiles from Rust to Go, to further enhance execution speed and compatibility within the EVM environment.
- **zk-SNARKs Integration** - Diving deeper into on-chain proof verifications and zero-knowledge proofs to enhance security and trust in decentralized applications.
- **Enhanced Decentralization** - Pushing Selene to replace centralized services by leveraging verified block headers and executing proofs in a trustless manner.
