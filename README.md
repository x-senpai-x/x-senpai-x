# Hi, I'm Utsav from IIT Roorkee! 👋

I'm a passionate blockchain developer and part of [BlocSocIITR](https://github.com/BlocSoc-iitr/), specializing in decentralized technologies, decentralized finance , zero knowledge and Ethereum light clients. Currently, I'm involved in various projects that span from building secure, trustless systems . Here’s a bit about me and what I’m working on:

---

### 🔭 Current Projects
- **Selene** - A **light client for Ethereum** developed in Go, inspired by Helios, but optimized for a Go environment. It provides essential modules such as client and consensus, verified block headers, and executes Merkle proofs. Future plans include creating a wallet integrated with Selene, enhancing the decentralized experience.
- **Neom** - A **trustless and permissionless portfolio manager**, powered by Selene, offering features like token balances, transaction history, portfolio value, and an NFT gallery. This project is designed to use decentralized data sources, making the data more secure and trustworthy.
- **EVM Execution & State Management** - Building an **EVM-based execution client package** in Go, working on block execution, state management, prefetching techniques.

---

### 💡 Areas of Expertise
- **Blockchain Development**: Ethereum, EVM, consensus layers, light client architecture,DeFi protocols .
- **Programming Languages**: Rust, Go, and experience with Solidity and smart contract ecosystems.
- **zk-Proofs & Verifications**: Working with on-chain verification methods like Groth16, Plonk, and exploring the use of gnark and Risc0 verifiers.

---

### 🧑‍💻 Technologies I’m Using
- **Languages**: Rust 🦀, Go 🐹 ,Solidity 

---

### 🌱 Currently Exploring
- **Advanced Precompiles** - Converting Ethereum-like precompiles from Rust to Go, to further enhance execution speed and compatibility within the EVM environment.
- **zk-SNARKs Integration** - Diving deeper into on-chain proof verifications and zero-knowledge proofs to enhance security and trust in decentralized applications.
- **Enhanced Decentralization** - Pushing Selene to replace centralized services by leveraging verified block headers and executing proofs in a trustless manner.
